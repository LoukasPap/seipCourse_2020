# 3rd Assignment: Unit Testing

This module aims to run multiple kinds of tests (JUnit) in multiple ways for 3 arithmetic operations:
1. Division
2. Multiplication
3. Factorial

After you have built the project following the [steps](https://github.com/LoukasPap/seipCourse_2020/blob/development/README.md) in the first README.md, continue below to run the tests.

## Running the tests
To simply run all the unit tests, execute from command line
`mvn test`
