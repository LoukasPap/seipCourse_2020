# 2nd Assignment: HistogramGenerator

Here, the executable .jar takes a path as a parameter. This path must lead to text file (.txt), that has each grade of a student in a separate line. Then, the frequency of the grades is counted and stored into a one-dimension array. At last, after reading this array, a diagram is being created, presenting the frequency of each grade.

### Prerequisites
1. A text file with one grade in each line.

After you have built the project following the [steps](https://github.com/LoukasPap/seipCourse_2020/blob/development/README.md) in the first README.md, continue below to run the module.

## Creating the histogram
The produced jar is located in the target directory and can be executed as following:

   `java -jar <pathOfJar> <pathOfTextFile>`

where _pathOfJar_ is the location of the downloaded .jar file, and _pathOfTextFile_ is the location of the text file.

Make sure your text file has each grade in separate lines.
